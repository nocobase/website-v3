/**
 * Point the CDN at a freshly uploaded site version, then delete the versions it replaced.
 *
 * A release is not an overwrite. Every build is uploaded to its own timestamp directory in the bucket, and publishing
 * is the single act of rewriting the CDN's back-to-origin rules to prefix that directory. Readers see the old site or
 * the new one, never a half-replaced mixture, and a bad release is rolled back by pointing the rules at the previous
 * directory rather than by re-uploading anything.
 *
 * This script does not upload. The workflow has already put the files in place by the time it runs; its arguments are
 * the directory to switch to and how many older versions to keep for rollback:
 *
 *   node deploy-cdn.mjs --timestamp <YYYYMMDDHHMMSS> [--keep <n>] [--cleanup-only]
 *
 * `--keep` defaults to 1, so the bucket holds the new version and the one before it. `--cleanup-only` is for a bucket
 * no CDN domain serves yet (`ALI_CDN_DOMAINS` empty): it switches and refreshes nothing and only removes the versions
 * `--keep` does not keep. Without it, an empty `ALI_CDN_DOMAINS` is an error.
 *
 * It serves both sites in this repository: `.github/workflows/docs.yml` (the documentation, `doc/`) and
 * `.github/workflows/site.yml` (the website, `html/`). Each passes its own bucket and domains through the environment:
 *
 * - `ALI_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `ALI_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET`: an Aliyun key allowed to manage the bucket and the CDN domains.
 * - `ALI_OSS_REGION`: the bucket's region as the OSS console shows it, `cn-beijing`; the `oss-` form is accepted too.
 * - `ALI_OSS_BUCKET`: the bucket the version directories live in.
 * - `ALI_CDN_DOMAINS`: the domains that serve the bucket, separated by whitespace or commas; must be empty with
 *   `--cleanup-only`.
 *
 * Copied from `.github/nocobase3/docs-publish/deploy-cdn.mjs` in 2013xile/nocobase-ci, which published the v3
 * documentation while this repository was private; that copy came from `docs/scripts/deploy-cdn.mjs` on `v3-develop` of
 * nocobase/nocobase. It differs in the names of its environment variables, in `--keep` and `--cleanup-only`, and in
 * refusing to clean up when the version just published is not in the bucket. Ported from the v2 `nocobase
 * docs:update` command. The rewrite rules are the load-bearing part and are reproduced with their original semantics —
 * read the comment above REWRITE_RULES before changing any of them.

 * The rules that turn a public URL into a path inside the current version directory. Order matters: every rule sets

 *
 * Two of these exist for reasons that are not obvious from reading them:
 *
 * - The `/api/ai/` rule comes first so the assistant's API calls pass through untouched. Without it the catch-all
 *   below would prefix them with a version directory and the assistant would call a path that does not exist.
 * - The two `[^.]*[^/.]` rules map extensionless URLs onto `index.html`. This is what makes clean URLs work on OSS, and
 *   it only works while the site build emits every page as `<path>/index.html` rather than `<path>.html`. Change one
 *   and the other has to change with it, or every page 404s.
 *
